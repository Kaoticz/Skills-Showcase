# Skills Showcase

This repository centralizes all personal projects, both big and small, that I have worked on. They are organized by programming language, so feel free to browse through them.

Some of the projects have repositories of their own. They are referenced as **Git Submodules**, appearing in the file explorer in blue. These projects are considered standalone products, designed to address real-world issues. They also have their own licenses, independent of this repository.

Projects appearing as regular folders are licensed under the [AGPLv3 License][License]. They are brief explorations of specific programming concepts, frameworks, and/or technologies that showcase my skills in those particular fields. Consider these as demos, which are not meant for real-world usage (although you are free to use them in real-world scenarios under the terms of the AGPLv3 License).
